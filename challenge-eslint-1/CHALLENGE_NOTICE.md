# Challenge Notice

## Brown Field Challenge: ESLint Rule Enhancement

This coding challenge is based on the **ESLint** open-source project, a widely-used JavaScript linting tool.

### Source Repository
- **Project**: ESLint
- **Repository**: https://github.com/eslint/eslint
- **License**: MIT License
- **Original File**: `lib/rules/no-console.js`

### What's Been Modified

This challenge contains a **simplified and modified version** of ESLint's `no-console` rule. The modifications include:

1. **Simplified structure** - Removed some complex dependencies to make it more suitable for a focused challenge
2. **Added challenge comments** - Hints and TODOs to guide the solution
3. **Intentional limitation** - The `canProvideSuggestions` function has been kept in its original state, which doesn't handle chained method calls properly

### Challenge Type: Brown Field

This is a **brown field challenge**, meaning you're working with existing, real-world code that has:
- ✅ Established patterns and conventions
- ✅ Real complexity from production code
- ✅ Existing tests that must continue passing
- ✅ Realistic edge cases and considerations

### Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:
- Work with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) manipulation
- Understand how ESLint rules are structured
- Practice extending existing functionality without breaking it
- Learn to navigate and understand real open-source codebases
- Experience debugging and enhancing production-quality code
